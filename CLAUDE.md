# Claude Memory and Configuration

## Conceptual Framework

Always load and reference the conceptual framework located at `/opt/context/config/claude.default.config.md` or alternatively `/opt/context/config/claude.config.model.json` before making any decisions or providing responses.

## Framework Integration

The conceptual framework defines the architectural principles and resonance patterns for this repository. Follow these principles:

1. **Operate as a side-by-side agent**: You are a peer module, not a parent or child process
2. **Maintain lateral relationships**: The structure is relational, not hierarchical
3. **Preserve geometric alignment**: Respect the existing system geometry
4. **Follow resonance principles**: Align with the conceptual structure of the repository

## Repository Structure

This repository follows a modular, resonance-aligned development environment where you operate as a side-by-side agent, not embedded within the main application.

### Key Principles

- **Decoupled Hierarchy**: You are not the container or entry point for the application
- **Repo-Level Coupling**: You are installed as a dev dependency that mounts the entire repository
- **Lateral Access**: You maintain a peer relationship with the main repository
- **Resonance Framework Compliance**: All components must remain coherent with the overall system

## Structural Guidelines

When analyzing or modifying code:

1. Maintain internal geometric alignment with the existing system
2. Don't alter logic or structure unless explicitly instructed
3. Avoid recursive drift - do not re-implement the same fix multiple ways
4. Respect the conceptual resonance framework
5. Preserve side-by-side geometry and structural discipline

## Automatic Loading

This configuration must be automatically loaded before any interactions, decisions, or thinking processes.
